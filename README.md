# GenAI YourTurn
The code needs to maintain a timer with the functionalities start, pause/resume, and set time. When start rotation button is clicked, the code will rotate between the swarm members.

## Does the code work?
Yes

## How is the code better?
It is cleaner and more organized.

## How is the code worse?
Does not incorporate actual data from the database.

## How many tries?
Took about 5 tries when considering all the backtracking when nonfunctional code was given.

## Overall Impression
Very useful for smaller tasks and/or generic ones like making molecule sized components. Larger, more complex interactions gets a bit more iffy.
